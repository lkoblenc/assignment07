		<h2>Balon Greyjoy</h2>
		<p>
			Balon Greyjoy is the head of House Greyjoy of Pyke and is the Lord of the Iron Islands. The captain of the Great Kraken, he is a follower of the Old Way of the ironborn and desires to bring them back to prominence. In 289 AC he proclaimed their independence from the Iron Throne, but Greyjoy's Rebellion was defeated by King Robert I Baratheon's forces. In the television adaptation Game of Thrones, Balon is played by Patrick Malahide. Balon had always been thin, but by 299 AC he is gaunt with a hard face. He has hard black eyes with long grey hair flecked with white that hangs past the small of his back. Balon has a personality to match his people: stubborn, fearless, and quarrelsome. He is uncompromising even when it comes to his own family, and his faith in the Drowned God and the Old Way is absolute.

		<h2>Theon Greyjoy</h2>
		<p>
			Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Theon is the son of Balon Greyjoy from the kingdom of Westeros. He subsequently appeared in A Clash of Kings (1998) and A Dance with Dragons (2011). He is one of the major third person points-of-view through which Martin narrates both books. Theon Greyjoy is the heir apparent and only living son of Balon Greyjoy. Theon is the narrator for a total of thirteen chapters in the second and fifth novels, A Clash of Kings and A Dance with Dragons. Ten years before the events of the series, Theon was taken hostage by Eddard Stark. He would have been executed had his father Balon displeased King Robert Baratheon. Theon was raised at Winterfell with the Stark children and developed a close friendship with Robb Stark. As an adult, Theon was arrogant, cocky, and proud until being imprisoned by Ramsay Snow, who is the eldest and bastard son of Roose Bolton.
